# GoldbergMachine

A Goldberg Machine made in Unity.

## Installation

When building, please remember to include both scenes in the build. The MainMenu scene should be set first.

Other than that, everything should work fine. The machine has a main menu and a restart menu, the latter should pop-up when the machine is finished.

## Demo

Demo gameplay of the machine can be watched on YouTube by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZAyHYOKNk).
